# Bubble Sort Algorithm

This is the first project that welcomes us into the Ruby Section of the *Microverse Remote Software Development Curriculum*.

This is a quick extract that helps explains the underlying concepts of bubble sort

### Bubble Sort Algorithm: Steps on how it works:
In an unsorted array of 5 elements, start with the first two elements and sort them in ascending order. (Compare the element to check which one is greater).

- Compare the second and third element to check which one is greater, and sort them in ascending order.
- Compare the third and fourth element to check which one is greater, and sort them in ascending order.
- Compare the fourth and fifth element to check which one is greater, and sort them in ascending order.
- Repeat steps 1‚Äì5 until no more swaps are required.

Simple right? Below is a simple animated illustration:
